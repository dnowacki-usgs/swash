Matlab utilities for interacting with the SWASH numerical model (http://swash.sf.net)

This repo contains the following functions:

* **load_dist.m**: Load .mat files generated by SWASH into a more easily usable format. The .mat files generated by SWASH create a separate variable for each timestep. This function combines each timestep into an N-dimensional matrix which is more pleasing to work with.
